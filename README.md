# msu_autorally_src

This repo contains the extension work performed by Michigan State University on AutoRally platform, which was originally developed by Georgia Tech. The main focus of this repo is the improvement of control software on the AutoRally platform by integrating the ROS Navigation Stack (contained in msu_autorally/msu_autorally_helper) and providing Evo-ROS a framework developed to allow evolutionary algorithms be ran utilizing ROS and Gazebo as an evaluation environment (contained in msu_autorally/evo_ros2).

The autorally directory was cloned from:https://github.com/AutoRally/autorally and modified slightly to suit the needs of the MSU research efforts.

The imu_3dm_gx4 directory was cloned from:https://github.com/AutoRally/imu_3dm_gx4 and is needed for the autorally platform. No edits have been made inside of this directory. 

Please see the msu_autorally_src wiki, link below, for more detailed installation and running instructions.
